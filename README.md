Multithread-Downloader
======================

"Today we are going to show how to speed up applications using threads in java. We use divide and conquer algorithm to check if program execution can be divided into fragments that can be executed separately. Our sample program is a simple downloader application which downloads images available under URLs. Program iterates through urls and downloads images one by one. To speed up our program we download an image in a separate thread." This is a tutorial material. Feel free to use it. Visit us at itcuties.com
